# cobaltResume

The goal of cobaltResume is to create professionally-looking résumés and cover letters. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of cobaltResume from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and load it into your session with:

```{r eval=F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sciarraseb/cobaltResume")
library(cobaltResume)
```

## Creating a résumé
This is a change 

Résumés can be created by first creating an R Markdown file with the cobaltResume template.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebsciarra/cobaltResume/master/docs/reference/figures/resume_template.png)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Creating a résumé from the cobaltResume template."}
knitr::include_graphics("docs/reference/figures/resume_template.png")
```




Résumés can be completed by using three features in resume template . First, information related to identification and skills can be included in the résumé by filling in the appropriate YAML header variables. 

```{yaml}
firstName: "firstName"
lastName: "lastName"
position: "Position" #job position being applied to 
date: "date" 
output: 
  pdf_document:
    template: "cobaltResume.tex"
#hyperlinks (delete or leave blank blank if not necessary/do not exist)
#escape any special characters with two backslashes (for example, see email variable)
